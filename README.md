## Open Source Overline Mining Pool

![Miner's stats page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1068089/106371835-e4035080-632e-11eb-9fdc-73c3bb420b5b.png)

### Features

* Support for HTTP and Stratum mining
* Detailed block stats with luck percentage and full reward
* Parity nodes rpc failover built in
* Modern beautiful Ember.js frontend
* Separate stats for workers: can highlight timed-out workers so miners can perform maintenance of rigs
* JSON-API for stats
* kubenetes based deployment for all elements of mining pool for maximum reliability

#### Proxies (not yet available)

* [Overline-Proxy](https://github.com/sammy007/ether-proxy) HTTP proxy with web interface
* [Stratum Proxy](https://github.com/Atrides/eth-proxy) for Overline

### Bringing a pool up in a linux environment

Dependencies:

  * go >= 1.13
  * bcnode (does it even have versions at this point, it's more a stream of consciousness)
  * redis-server >= 2.8.0
  * nodejs ~ 10 LTS
  * nginx
  * kubernetes >= 1.20 (use minikube for local / non-production builds)

**I highly recommend to use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.**

This whole installation is containerized and comes with a full kubernetes based setup.
Below we will walk through instructions for running the pool on minikube in a testing environment.


1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/overline-mining/open-overline-pool.git`

2. Install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

3. Install [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/#binary-download)

4. Update bcnode image:

    ```bash
    cd open-overline-pool/docker
    ./build-images.sh
    ```

5.1 Setup secrets:

  ```bash
    cd open-overline-pool/k8s
    # NOTE -->  edit the file "config" to contain whatever addresses, http auth passwords, and keys you wish to use
    ./make-secrets.sh
    # NOTE --> you will need to re-run this after you changed something, or part of the pool wont work
  ```

5.2 Set the bcnode to bootstrap mode:
    
  ```bash
    nano open-overline-pool/bcnode/deployment.yml
    # NOTE -->  edit the file way at the bottom to this:
    
             name: vol-bcnode-db
        command: ['sh','-c']
        args:
        - rm -r /data/db;     # !!!!!!!To start the bootstrap mode, it will fail if this isnt included
          if [ ! -d "/data/db" ]; then
            echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" >> /etc/resolv.conf;
            echo "nameserver 8.8.4.4" >> /etc/resolv.conf;
            apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget unzip;
            until [ -f .uploaded ]; do sleep 1; ls -lh _easysync_db.tar.gz; done;
            tar -xvzf _easysync_db.tar.gz -C /data --strip-components=1;   #!!!! set --strip-components to 1        
            rm /data/db/IDENTITY;
            rm /data/.chainstate.db;
            rm _easysync_db.tar.gz;
            rm .uploaded;
          fi;
          echo "done!";
    
    #Exit and save the file once edited
  ```

6. Initialize bcnode (you will need a chainstate snapshot saved as a `.tar.gz` file):

    ```bash
    cd open-overline-pool/k8s
    kubectl apply -f bcnode/
    ./upload-db.sh $(kubectl get pods | grep bcnode | awk '{print $1}') /path/to/chainstate.tar.gz
    # wait for a bit for the node's initialization container to unpack the chainstate
    # follow progress with
    kubectl logs $(kubectl get pods | grep bcnode | awk '{print $1}') -c get-bcnode-db-container -f --tail 10
    # once that is done follow the bcnode logs and wait for it to sync
    kubectl logs $(kubectl get pods | grep bcnode | awk '{print $1}') -c bcnode -f --tail 10
    ```

7. While the bcnode is syncing, setup redis.

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f redis/
    ```

8. Once the node has fully synced, change the node deployment.yml back from Bootstrap mode, so it wont clear itself on every start

    ```bash
    
    nano /bcnode/deployment.yml
    # NOTE -->  edit the file way at the bottom to this:
    
             name: vol-bcnode-db
        command: ['sh','-c']
        args:
        - rm -r /data/db/IDENTITY;     # !!!!!!!To prevent the bootstrap, so the node wont wipe itself on startup
          if [ ! -d "/data/db" ]; then
            echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" >> /etc/resolv.conf;
            echo "nameserver 8.8.4.4" >> /etc/resolv.conf;
            apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget unzip;
            until [ -f .uploaded ]; do sleep 1; ls -lh _easysync_db.tar.gz; done;
            tar -xvzf _easysync_db.tar.gz -C /data --strip-components=1;       
            rm /data/db/IDENTITY;
            rm /data/.chainstate.db;
            rm _easysync_db.tar.gz;
            rm .uploaded;
          fi;
          echo "done!";

    # Exit and save the file after you changed it.

    # Then we need to kill the node to apply the settings.
    kubectl delete -f bcnode/deployment.yml
    # Now lets apply the settings
    kubectl apply -f bcnode/deployment.yml

    ```

9. Once the bcnode is back up and synced again we bring open-overline-pool online as follows:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f open-overline-pool/
    ./local-port-forward.sh
    ```

10. You should now be able to point a browser to `localhost` and see the splash page. You can also test that the pool is accepting jobs by pointing a overline-compatible stratum miner at it.

#### Customization

You can customize the layout using built-in web server with live reload:

    ember server --port 8082 --environment development

**Don't use built-in web server in production**.

Check out <code>www/app/templates</code> directory and edit these templates
in order to customise the frontend.

### Configuration

Configuration is actually simple, just read it twice and think twice before changing defaults.

**Don't copy config directly from this manual. Use the example config from the package,
otherwise you will get errors on start because of JSON comments.**

  }
}
```

If you are distributing your pool deployment to several servers or processes,
create several configs and disable unneeded modules on each server. (Advanced users)

I recommend this deployment strategy:

* Mining instance - 1x (it depends, you can run one node for EU, one for US, one for Asia)
* Unlocker and payouts instance - 1x each (strict!)
* API instance - 1x

### Notes

* Unlocking and payouts are sequential, 1st tx go, 2nd waiting for 1st to confirm and so on. You can disable that in code. Carefully read `docs/PAYOUTS.md`.
* Also, keep in mind that **unlocking and payouts will halt in case of backend or node RPC errors**. In that case check everything and restart.
* You must restart module if you see errors with the word *suspended*.
* Don't run payouts and unlocker modules as part of mining node. Create separate configs for both, launch independently and make sure you have a single instance of each module running.
* If `poolFeeAddress` is not specified all pool profit will remain on coinbase address. If it specified, make sure to periodically send some dust back required for payments.
